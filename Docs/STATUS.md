# Project status

Last updated: 7 October 2026

## Summary

Environment and Cursor ↔ Godot MCP connection are **verified**. Milestone 0 conventions are **Confirmed**, registered in `project.godot`, and **verified** by an automated test scene (6/6 checks, 0 errors, 0 warnings). One manual check remains: pressing real keys/gamepad buttons. No gameplay has been implemented.

## Environment — Verified

| Item | Value | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10/11 (build 26100) | Cursor environment |
| Godot | **4.7.2 stable** (official, build `ed1daf0bf`) | MCP `get_runtime_status`; engine log |
| Renderer | **Compatibility** (`gl_compatibility`, OpenGL 3.3, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU) | `project.godot`; engine log |
| Node.js / npm / Git | v22.14.0 / 11.18.0 / 2.45.1 | Terminal |
| Godot MCP | `godot-mcp-server` via `npx` (server reported version 0.6.0); editor add-on `addons/godot_mcp`; WebSocket port 6505 | MCP `get_godot_status` |
| Project name | `CampusHorror` | `project.godot` |

## Verification log

| Date | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-07 | MCP read-only inspection (project, version, scene tree) | Pass |
| 2026-10-07 | MCPCheck integration test (`scenes/tests/MCPCheck.tscn`) | Pass: launched, rectangle visible, 0 errors / 0 warnings |
| 2026-10-07 | Milestone 0 test (`scenes/tests/Milestone0Test.tscn`), run alone through MCP | **Pass: 6/6 automated checks, 0 errors / 0 warnings.** Screenshots confirm behind-prop, in-front-of-prop, under-canopy and against-wall poses. |
| 2026-10-07 | Main scene setting | Unchanged (empty) |
| 2026-10-07 | Display / renderer settings | Unchanged |

Milestone 0 automated checks:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| 7 input actions registered | Pass |
| Physics layers 1–5 named `world`, `player`, `interactable`, `enemy`, `trigger` | Pass |
| Test character on layer 2 / mask 1; wall and prop on layer 1 / mask 0 | Pass |
| Feet origin (visual bottom and footprint bottom at y = 0; footprint 12 of 64 px tall) | Pass |
| Draw-order setup (ground z −10, Y-sorted objects z 0, overhead z 10) | Pass |
| Wall blocks character (travelled 86 of 300 px; footprint stopped at wall face x = 860) | Pass |

## Milestones

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| Environment / MCP setup | **Verified** |
| 0. Project conventions | **Verified** (automated). Conventions Confirmed in `Docs/CONVENTIONS.md`; input actions + layer names registered; test scene passes. Manual real-device input check pending. |
| A. Main, placeholder player, movement, camera | Not started |
| B. Interaction | Not started |
| C. Zones, doors, spawn markers | Not started |
| D. GameState + persistent pickup | Not started |
| E. SaveService | Not started |
| F. Lighting test | Not started |
| G. Custom art sample | Not started |
| H. Desktop export | Not started |

### Manual checks for the user

1. Open `scenes/tests/Milestone0Test.tscn`, press F6, and press W/A/S/D, the arrow keys, E, F and Escape (and a gamepad, if available). Each should appear in the top-left "Actions pressed" readout. If a real device doesn't register, see the device note in `Docs/CONVENTIONS.md` §1.
2. Watch the pose cycle (every 2 s) and confirm the draw order looks right to you.

## Project contents

- `scenes/tests/MCPCheck.tscn`: temporary MCP test scene. Not the main scene; safe to delete later.
- `scenes/tests/Milestone0Test.tscn` + `milestone_0_test.gd`: Milestone 0 conventions test (placeholder shapes; character moved by the test, not by player input). Not the main scene.
- `addons/godot_mcp/`: MCP editor add-on (registers the `MCPRuntime` autoload used for runtime inspection/screenshots).
- `project.godot`: 7 input actions and 5 named 2D physics layers registered.
- No gameplay scenes, player controller, managers or main scene yet.

## Still undecided

Final base resolution, tile size, art style (pixel vs stylized/vector vs rendered), texture filter, integer scaling/pixel snap, final camera tuning, target platform, mechanic-specific controls and collision rules. Full list in `Docs/CONVENTIONS.md` → "Still undecided".

## Known issues / notes

- `config/features` in `project.godot` still says `"Forward Plus"` (creation-time label); the active renderer is Compatibility.
- Input events registered by the MCP tool use device `16` (keyboard) / `0` (first gamepad) instead of the editor's "All Devices". Synthetic input works; real-device check pending.
- `addons/godot_mcp/cache/undo/stack.json` and `entry_000001/` were committed before `addons/godot_mcp/cache/` was added to `.gitignore`, so Git still tracks them and shows them as modified. Untracking them needs `git rm -r --cached addons/godot_mcp/cache` (not done).
- The docs folder is `Docs/` (capital D) while the blueprint refers to `docs/`. Windows treats them as the same; on case-sensitive systems paths must match `Docs/`.

## Next task

Do the manual input check above, review the diff and commit Milestone 0. Then start Milestone A (Main container, placeholder player, movement, camera).
